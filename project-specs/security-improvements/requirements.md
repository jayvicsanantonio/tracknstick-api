# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Based on the security review conducted on the TrackNStick API, several critical vulnerabilities and security gaps were identified that require immediate attention. The most critical issue is a complete JWT authentication bypass in the Clerk middleware, along with missing rate limiting, overly permissive CORS configuration, and information disclosure in error responses.

This security improvement initiative will address these vulnerabilities systematically, implementing proper authentication verification, comprehensive rate limiting, environment-aware security configurations, and hardened error handling. The goal is to elevate the API's security posture from vulnerable to production-ready while maintaining existing functionality and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Secure JWT Token Validation
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want JWT tokens to be cryptographically verified, so that only authenticated users with valid tokens can access protected endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a request contains a JWT token THEN the system SHALL verify the token signature using Clerk's verification methods
2. WHEN a token signature is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the request with 401 Unauthorized
3. WHEN a token is expired THEN the system SHALL reject the request with 401 Unauthorized
4. WHEN a token is malformed THEN the system SHALL reject the request with 401 Unauthorized
5. WHEN token verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL extract user claims and proceed with the request

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Rate Limiting Protection
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want API endpoints protected by rate limiting, so that the system is resilient against abuse, DDoS attacks, and brute force attempts.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN rate limiting is applied THEN the system SHALL limit requests per IP address per time window
2. WHEN rate limit is exceeded THEN the system SHALL respond with 429 Too Many Requests
3. WHEN rate limiting is active THEN the system SHALL include rate limit headers in responses
4. WHEN different endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL apply endpoint-specific rate limits
5. WHEN rate limit windows reset THEN the system SHALL allow new requests up to the limit

### Requirement 3: Environment-Aware Security Configuration
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want security policies that adapt to deployment environments, so that development flexibility doesn't compromise production security.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN in production environment THEN the system SHALL restrict CORS to production domains only
2. WHEN in development environment THEN the system SHALL allow localhost CORS origins
3. WHEN environment is detected THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate security header policies
4. WHEN security configuration loads THEN the system SHALL validate environment-specific settings
5. WHEN invalid environment detected THEN the system SHALL default to most restrictive security settings

### Requirement 4: Secure Error Response Handling
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want error responses that don't expose internal system details, so that attackers cannot gather intelligence about the application structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN an error occurs in production THEN the system SHALL return generic error messages
2. WHEN an error occurs in development THEN the system SHALL include detailed error information
3. WHEN logging errors THEN the system SHALL capture full details for debugging
4. WHEN responding to clients THEN the system SHALL exclude stack traces in production
5. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL not expose schema or query details

### Requirement 5: Security Middleware Integration
**User Story:** As a developer, I want security middleware properly integrated into the request pipeline, so that all endpoints are consistently protected without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a request is processed THEN the system SHALL apply security middleware in correct order
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL verify JWT before processing requests
3. WHEN rate limiting is enabled THEN the system SHALL check limits before authentication
4. WHEN security headers are configured THEN the system SHALL include them in all responses
5. WHEN middleware fails THEN the system SHALL prevent request processing and log the failure

### Requirement 6: Security Testing and Validation
**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive security tests, so that security measures are verified and regressions are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN security middleware is tested THEN the system SHALL verify proper token validation behavior
2. WHEN rate limiting is tested THEN the system SHALL verify limit enforcement and reset behavior
3. WHEN CORS is tested THEN the system SHALL verify origin restrictions work correctly
4. WHEN error handling is tested THEN the system SHALL verify information disclosure prevention
5. WHEN integration tests run THEN the system SHALL validate end-to-end security flows
