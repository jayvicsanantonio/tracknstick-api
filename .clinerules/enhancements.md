# Refactoring: Enhancements & Future Work

This document outlines enhancements made during the refactoring and identifies areas for future improvement.

## Enhancements Implemented

1.  **Improved Code Structure:** Transitioned from a single-file approach (`index.js`) to a layered architecture (Controllers, Services, Repositories), significantly improving organization and separation of concerns.
2.  **Asynchronous Code Handling:** Replaced callback-based `sqlite3` operations with `async/await` using promise wrappers (`dbAll`, `dbGet`, `dbRun`), making asynchronous code cleaner and easier to manage.
3.  **Centralized Database Utilities:** Consolidated database connection, schema initialization, and promise wrappers into `src/utils/dbUtils.js`.
4.  **Environment-Based Configuration:** Implemented `dotenv` to manage environment variables (e.g., `DATABASE_PATH`, `PORT`) via `.env.local` (for development) and `process.env`. Updated `dbUtils.js` to use `DATABASE_PATH`.
5.  **Code Quality Tooling:** Integrated ESLint and Prettier for automated code linting and formatting, enforcing consistency and catching potential issues.
6.  **Clearer Routing:** Defined routes using `express.Router` in `src/api/habits.routes.js`, separating routing logic from the main application setup.
7.  **Refined Centralized Error Handling:** Implemented a dedicated error-handling middleware (`src/middlewares/errorHandler.js`) and custom error classes (`src/utils/errors.js`). Refined repositories and authentication middleware to throw specific `DatabaseError`. Ensured generic 500 responses in production.
8.  **Utility Function Extraction:** Extracted helper functions (`getLocaleStartEnd`, `calculateStreak`) from the service layer into dedicated utility files (`src/utils/dateUtils.js`, `src/utils/streakUtils.js`) for better separation and reusability.
9.  **Database Transactions:** Implemented atomic transactions for the `deleteHabit` operation using a centralized `withTransaction` utility (`src/utils/transactionUtils.js`) to ensure data consistency.

## Potential Future Enhancements

1.  **Input Validation (Refinement):**
    - While basic validation exists via `express-validator`, further refinement could involve more complex cross-field validation if needed, or custom sanitizers. (Note: The current implementation already uses `express-validator` via `validate.js` middleware).
2.  **Testing:**
    - Add comprehensive unit tests for services and repositories (using mocking for dependencies).
    - Add integration tests for API endpoints to verify end-to-end functionality.
3.  **API Documentation Generation:**
    - Explore tools like Swagger/OpenAPI to automatically generate API documentation from code comments or route definitions.
4.  **Dependency Injection:**
    - For larger applications, consider implementing a dependency injection container to manage the instantiation and wiring of services and repositories.
5.  **User Management Integration:**
    - If integrating with Clerk or another authentication provider, implement logic to create the corresponding user record in the local `users` table upon first authentication or sign-up.
6.  **UserRepository:**
    - Create a `UserRepository` to handle user-related database operations (e.g., finding user by API key), moving this logic out of the `authenticate` middleware to better adhere to the layered architecture.
