# Refactoring: Enhancements & Future Work

This document outlines enhancements made during the refactoring and identifies areas for future improvement.

## Enhancements Implemented

1.  **Improved Code Structure:** Transitioned from a single-file approach (`index.js`) to a layered architecture (Controllers, Services, Repositories), significantly improving organization and separation of concerns.
2.  **Asynchronous Code Handling:** Replaced callback-based `sqlite3` operations with `async/await` using promise wrappers (`dbAll`, `dbGet`, `dbRun`), making asynchronous code cleaner and easier to manage.
3.  **Centralized Database Utilities:** Consolidated database connection, schema initialization, and promise wrappers into `src/utils/dbUtils.js`.
4.  **Robust Database Path:** Used `path.resolve` to ensure the application consistently connects to the correct database file in the project root.
5.  **Code Quality Tooling:** Integrated ESLint and Prettier for automated code linting and formatting, enforcing consistency and catching potential issues.
6.  **Clearer Routing:** Defined routes using `express.Router` in `src/api/habits.routes.js`, separating routing logic from the main application setup.
7.  **Centralized Error Handling:** Implemented a dedicated error-handling middleware (`src/middlewares/errorHandler.js`) and custom error classes (`src/utils/errors.js`) to standardize error responses, provide unique error codes, and offer detailed validation feedback. Replaced basic error handling.
8.  **Utility Function Extraction:** Extracted helper functions (`getLocaleStartEnd`, `calculateStreak`) from the service layer into dedicated utility files (`src/utils/dateUtils.js`, `src/utils/streakUtils.js`) for better separation and reusability.

## Potential Future Enhancements

1.  **Input Validation (Refinement):**
    - While basic validation exists via `express-validator`, further refinement could involve more complex cross-field validation if needed, or custom sanitizers. (Note: The current implementation already uses `express-validator` via `validate.js` middleware).
2.  **Database Transactions:**
    - Implement database transactions for operations that involve multiple dependent database writes (e.g., deleting a habit and its associated trackers) to ensure atomicity. The `sqlite3` library supports `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`.
3.  **Testing:**
    - Add comprehensive unit tests for services and repositories (using mocking for dependencies).
    - Add integration tests for API endpoints to verify end-to-end functionality.
4.  **Configuration Management:**
    - Move configuration values (like CORS settings, potentially database paths if they become dynamic) into a dedicated `src/config` directory or use a configuration library.
5.  **API Documentation Generation:**
    - Explore tools like Swagger/OpenAPI to automatically generate API documentation from code comments or route definitions.
6.  **Dependency Injection:**
    - For larger applications, consider implementing a dependency injection container to manage the instantiation and wiring of services and repositories.
7.  **User Management Integration:**
    - If integrating with Clerk or another authentication provider, implement logic to create the corresponding user record in the local `users` table upon first authentication or sign-up.
