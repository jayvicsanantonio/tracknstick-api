# Controller Implementation Refactoring

This document explains the refactoring process related to the Controller layer (`src/controllers/`) in the Habit Tracker API.

## Initial State

In the original structure, the logic for handling HTTP requests, validating input, interacting with the database, and formatting responses was directly embedded within the route handler callback functions defined in `index.js` (e.g., `app.get('/habits', (req, res) => { /* all logic here */ })`). This led to large, complex route handlers that violated the Single Responsibility Principle and were difficult to test and maintain.

## Decision: Introduce Controller Layer

As part of adopting a layered architecture, we decided to introduce a dedicated Controller layer. The primary goal was to separate the concerns related to handling the HTTP request/response cycle from the core business logic and data access logic.

## Rationale

1.  **Separation of Concerns:** Isolates HTTP-specific tasks (parsing request objects like `req.params`, `req.query`, `req.body`, sending responses using `res.json()`, `res.status()`) from business rules and database interactions.
2.  **Thinner Route Handlers:** Keeps the functions directly handling routes clean and focused solely on orchestrating the request flow: receive request -> call service -> send response/handle error.
3.  **Improved Readability & Maintainability:** Makes the code easier to understand by clearly defining where HTTP handling occurs. Changes to response formatting or request parsing are localized to the controller.
4.  **Testability:** While controllers can still be harder to unit test due to their reliance on `req` and `res`, separating business logic into services makes the _services_ highly testable.

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Create `src/controllers/` Directory:** A dedicated directory was created to house all controller files.
2.  **Create Controller File (`habit.controller.js`):** A file was created for each primary resource (e.g., `habits`).
3.  **Define Controller Functions:** For each route defined in the corresponding router (`habits.routes.js`), a dedicated asynchronous controller function was created (e.g., `getHabits`, `createHabit`, `updateHabit`). These functions follow the standard Express middleware signature `(req, res, next)`.
4.  **Extract Request Handling Logic:** The logic for extracting data from the `req` object (`req.params.habitId`, `req.userId` from auth middleware, `req.body`, `req.query`) was moved into the respective controller functions.
5.  **Remove Business/Data Logic:** All direct database calls (`db.prepare`, `db.get`, `db.run`, etc.) and core business logic (like date calculations, data transformations beyond simple formatting) were removed from the controller functions.
6.  **Call Service Layer:** Controller functions were updated to call the corresponding functions in the newly created Service layer (`habit.service.js`), passing the necessary data extracted from the request.
7.  **Handle Service Response:** Controller functions now receive results (or errors) from the service layer. They are responsible for:
    - Formatting the successful response (e.g., `res.json(habits)`).
    - Setting appropriate status codes (e.g., `res.status(201)` for creation).
    - Translating service results into HTTP responses (e.g., if a service returns `null` indicating "not found", the controller sends a 404 response).
8.  **Implement Error Handling (`try...catch` and `next`):** Asynchronous service calls within controllers were wrapped in `try...catch` blocks. Any caught errors are passed to the `next(error)` function, delegating error handling to a subsequent (ideally centralized) error handling middleware.
9.  **Update Router:** The route definitions in `src/api/habits.routes.js` were updated to reference the newly created controller functions instead of inline handlers.

## Benefits Achieved

- Controllers are now significantly leaner and focused purely on the HTTP interface.
- Clear separation between request/response handling and business/data logic.
- Improved code organization and readability.
- Paved the way for easier testing of the decoupled Service layer.
