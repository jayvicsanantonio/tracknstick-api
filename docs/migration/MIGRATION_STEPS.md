# Express to Hono Migration: Implementation Steps

This document provides a step-by-step guide for implementing the Express to Hono migration for the TrackNStick API.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the migration:
- Back up your codebase
- Ensure all tests are passing with the current Express implementation
- Create a new branch for the migration work

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update Dependencies

1. Replace the content of your package.json with the migrated version (package.hono.json)
2. Run `npm install` to install Hono and other new dependencies

```bash
mv package.hono.json package.json
npm install
```

### Step 2: Core Application Structure

1. Review the Hono entry point (index.hono.js)
2. Replace your current index.js with the Hono version
3. Update any imports or references as needed

```bash
mv index.hono.js index.js
```

### Step 3: Migrate Middleware

1. Error Handling
   - Review errorHandler.hono.js
   - Replace the current implementation
   
   ```bash
   mv src/middlewares/errorHandler.hono.js src/middlewares/errorHandler.js
   ```

2. Validation
   - Review validate.hono.js (Zod-based validation)
   - Replace the current implementation
   
   ```bash
   mv src/middlewares/validate.hono.js src/middlewares/validate.js
   ```

3. Authentication
   - Use @hono/clerk-auth package for authentication
   - Add it to your dependencies if not already added
   
   ```bash
   npm install @hono/clerk-auth
   ```

### Step 4: Migrate Validators

1. Replace express-validator schemas with Zod schemas
   - Review habit.validator.hono.js
   - Update all validators to use Zod
   
   ```bash
   mv src/validators/habit.validator.hono.js src/validators/habit.validator.js
   ```

### Step 5: Migrate Routes

1. Update route definitions to use Hono
   - Review habits.routes.hono.js
   - Replace current routes implementation
   
   ```bash
   mv src/api/habits.routes.hono.js src/api/habits.routes.js
   ```

### Step 6: Create Controller Middleware

1. Implement a controller wrapper middleware for handling common patterns
   - Create controllerHandler.js with authentication, error handling, and context management
   ```bash
   touch src/middlewares/controllerHandler.js
   ```
   - Implement Higher-Order Component (HOC) pattern for controllers
   - Add functions for withAuth, withErrorHandling, and the combined controller wrapper

### Step 7: Migrate Controllers

1. Update controllers to use Hono's context and the new controller wrapper
   - Refactor controllers to use the HOC pattern
   - Remove duplicate authentication and error handling code
   - Focus controller functions on business logic only

### Step 8: Testing

1. Run the server with the new implementation
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Test all API endpoints to ensure they work as expected
   - Authentication
   - Habit creation/retrieval/update/deletion
   - Trackers and statistics

3. Check error handling and validation

### Step 9: Performance Optimization

1. Review any areas where Hono-specific optimizations can be applied
2. Consider implementing Hono's built-in caching if appropriate
3. Optimize middleware usage for your specific use cases

### Step 10: Deploy

1. Test in a staging environment
2. Monitor for any issues or performance differences
3. Deploy to production when confident

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Problems

If you experience authentication issues:
- Check that the Clerk middleware is correctly parsing tokens
- Verify that authentication data is properly passed through the Hono context

### Validation Errors

If validation isn't working as expected:
- Ensure Zod schemas match the previous express-validator rules
- Check that the validation middleware is correctly passing errors

### Route Handling

If routes aren't matching as expected:
- Review Hono's routing patterns which may differ slightly from Express
- Check for any route-specific middleware that might need adaptation

### Response Format Differences

If API responses look different:
- Ensure all controllers are using `c.json()` consistently
- Check for any custom response formatters that might need updating

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise that can't be quickly resolved:

1. Revert to the Express implementation
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. Document the issues encountered for future migration attempts
