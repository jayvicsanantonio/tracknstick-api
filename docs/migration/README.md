## Overview

The migration from Express to Hono was undertaken to:

- Improve performance and reduce latency
- Enable deployment to edge computing environments
- Modernize the codebase with latest web standards
- Simplify middleware architecture and request handling
- Improve maintainability through better separation of concerns

Key architectural improvements include:

1. Implementation of a Higher-Order Component (HOC) pattern for controllers
2. Better authentication through @hono/clerk-auth
3. More robust validation with Zod schemas
4. Cleaner error handling with Hono's throw/catch pattern
