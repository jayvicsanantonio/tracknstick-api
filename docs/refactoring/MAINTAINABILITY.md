# Refactoring: Maintainability Improvements

This document details how the refactoring effort improved the maintainability of the Habit Tracker API codebase.

## Key Improvements

1.  **Separation of Concerns (SoC):**

    - **Before:** Most logic (routing, validation, business rules, database interaction) was intertwined within `index.js`.
    - **After:** Logic is clearly separated into distinct layers (Controllers, Services, Repositories).
    - **Benefit:** Reduces complexity of individual files, makes it easier to locate specific code, and minimizes the risk of unintended side effects when making changes. Modifying database logic doesn't require touching controller code, and vice-versa.

2.  **Code Organization:**

    - **Before:** Code primarily in the root directory (`index.js`, `db.js`, `middlewares/`).
    - **After:** A structured `src/` directory with subdirectories for each layer (`api`, `controllers`, `services`, `repositories`, `middlewares`, `utils`).
    - **Benefit:** Provides a clear and conventional project structure, making navigation easier for current and future developers.

3.  **Readability:**

    - **Before:** Large route handler functions performing multiple tasks. Callback-based database operations (`sqlite3` raw driver) led to nested code ("callback hell").
    - **After:**
      - Controllers are thinner, focusing on HTTP aspects.
      - Services encapsulate business logic.
      - Repositories handle data access.
      - Consistent use of `async/await` with promise wrappers for database calls significantly improves asynchronous code flow and readability.
    - **Benefit:** Code is easier to read, understand, and follow.

4.  **Reduced Coupling:**

    - **Before:** Controllers and route handlers were directly dependent on the `sqlite3` driver and database schema details.
    - **After:** Controllers depend on Services, and Services depend on Repositories. Only Repositories interact directly with the database utilities.
    - **Benefit:** Changes to the database implementation (e.g., switching to another ORM/driver or database) primarily impact the Repository layer, minimizing changes needed in other parts of the application.

5.  **Consistency:**

    - **Before:** Database interactions were performed directly in route handlers using raw driver methods.
    - **After:** Database interactions are consistently handled through Repository methods using standardized promise wrappers (`dbAll`, `dbGet`, `dbRun`).
    - **Benefit:** Ensures database access patterns are uniform across the application.

6.  **Linting and Formatting:**
    - **Before:** No automated enforcement of code style or quality checks.
    - **After:** ESLint and Prettier configured with `eslint-config-airbnb-base` and integrated via `package.json` scripts (`lint`, `format`).
    - **Benefit:** Enforces consistent code style, catches potential errors early, and improves overall code quality and consistency, reducing cognitive load when reading code.

## Future Considerations

- Implement dedicated validation middleware (`express-validator`) to further thin controllers.
- Implement centralized error handling for more consistent error responses.
- Extract helper functions (e.g., date/streak calculations) into `utils`.
- Add automated tests (unit, integration) to ensure maintainability over time.
